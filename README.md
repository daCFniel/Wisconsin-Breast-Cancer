# Wisconsin-Breast-Cancer
This project focuses on the analysis of a breast cancer dataset. The primary objective is to select a classification algorithm, explore its performance using cross-validation, and analyze the resulting bias-variance tradeoff. Additionally, feature importance analysis is conducted to identify attributes correlated with breast cancer diagnosis.
